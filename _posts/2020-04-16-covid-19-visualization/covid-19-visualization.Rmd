## Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic Course
U.C. Berkeley School of Public Health has an online, self-paced course to provide the public a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

As part of this course, Dr. Sandi McCoy gave a lecture regarding proven interventions and and what we know works. To support this presentation, I created a visualization how the natural history of some of the most commonly known pathogens changes the mitigation and control strategies that are effective.

```
