This is my #rstats zine of 30 unique computational art pieces with accompanying code deep diving into radial objects. They are categorized by themes, but the order of completion is also indicated. All of these are created solely using `{ggplot2}` in R and the zine was created using the `{xaringan}` package.

```{r xaringan-slides, echo = FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "https://ijeamakaanyene.github.io/patterns/zine/zine_radial_patterns.html",
                              ratio = "16:9")

```
