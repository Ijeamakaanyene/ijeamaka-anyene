I'm a data analyst working in healthcare research and I have a masters in public health in epidemiology and biostatistics from U.C. Berkeley.  

I'm currently working on boosting my SAS & R skills, focusing mostly on R. For work and leisure, I use R for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization.
