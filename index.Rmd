I'm a data analyst working in healthcare research and I have a masters in public health in epidemiology and biostatistics from U.C. Berkeley.  

I specialize in using R and SAS for data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualizations. 

In an effort to practice "learning out loud", I'm sharing short & quick blog posts (#TIL) of my learnings as I tackle projects. Check them out on the blog posts page!
